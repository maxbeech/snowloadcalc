// snow load for a site comes from the ASCE 7 Hazard Tool or the local building
// department, not from a national lookup. The ranges below are planning ranges
// for the *populated* parts of each state, read from the ASCE 7 ground snow
// load map (Fig. 7.2-1) and common state code amendments. Mountainous states
// are flagged `caseStudy` because elevation — not the state — sets the value,
// and it can range from ~30 to 150+ psf within one county. We never assert a
// false per-ZIP precision: every page tells the user to confirm with their AHJ.
