  { q: "When do I need to check snow drift?", a: "Whenever a lower roof sits next to a taller roof, a parapet or a long rooftop unit. ASCE 7 §7.7 says drift can be ignored only when the clear height above the balanced snow is small (hc/hb < 0.2); otherwise the drift surcharge often governs the lower roof." },
  { q: "How is the drift height calculated?", a: "The leeward drift height is hd = 0.43 × (Lu)^(1/3) × (Pg + 10)^(1/4) − 1.5 ft, where Lu is the upper roof length and Pg the ground snow load. The windward case uses 0.75× of the same formula with the lower-roof length. The larger governs, capped at the clear height." },
  { q: "What load does the drift add?", a: "The peak surcharge is pd = hd × γ, where γ = 0.13·Pg + 14 pcf (capped at 30). It is a triangular load that sits on top of the balanced load against the step, tapering to zero over the drift width." },
